# pathfinding_framework

A starter repository for building and experimenting with pathfinding algorithms and reusable framework components.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your source code under `src/`.
3. Add tests under `tests/`.

## Roadmap

- Core graph abstractions
- Pluggable pathfinding algorithms (BFS, Dijkstra, A*)
- Benchmark and visualization utilities
